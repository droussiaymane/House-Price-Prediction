Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/droussiaymane/House-Price-Prediction
Navigate to the project directory.
bash
Copy code
cd House-Price-Prediction
Follow the instructions provided in each project phase's dedicated subdirectory.
Dependencies
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook (for data analysis and modeling)
Required Python libraries (specified in the subdirectories for data cleaning and model training)
Web scraping tools (if needed)
Data Collection
In the data collection phase, web scraping techniques are used to gather real estate data from various online sources. The collected data is stored for further processing.

Data Cleaning
The data cleaning phase involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data to ensure it's suitable for analysis and modeling. Please follow the data cleaning instructions in the dedicated subdirectory.

Model Selection and Training
The model selection and training phase involve selecting an appropriate machine learning algorithm, performing feature engineering, and training the predictive model. Detailed instructions can be found in the dedicated subdirectory.

Error Analysis
After the model is trained, it's crucial to assess its accuracy and performance. Error analysis is performed using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R-squared. Refer to the error analysis subdirectory for details.

Deployment
The deployment phase involves integrating the trained model into a production environment. Instructions for this phase can be found in the dedicated subdirectory.

Monitoring
To ensure the model's continued accuracy, it should be continuously monitored and updated to adapt to changes in the real estate market. Instructions for monitoring the model can be found in the dedicated subdirectory.

Contributing
If you'd like to contribute to this project, please follow these guidelines (if available). We welcome contributions to improve the model, data collection, or any other aspect of the project.
